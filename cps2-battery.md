# How to replace a Capcom CPS2 Battery

CPS2 is an encrypted system and uses a RAM chip powered by a battery to hold a decryption key allowing the CPU to execute the game. When the battery dies, your decryption key is lost since the RAM chip no longer has power. This coined the notorious term "suicide battery" amongst CPS2 collectors world wide.

A better option is to remove the battery completely. This retains the decryption key while removing the battery entirely of your CPS board reducing the risk of leaking/acid damage. Here are the options.



## CPS2 Suicide Free Modchip

Burn on a PIC12F675 or PIC12F629 the HEX file of your romset.? 

**What is the difference between both PICS?**

The PIC12F675 has a larger program memory size of 8K x 14 words compared to the PIC12F629 which has a program memory size of 4K x 14 words.

The PIC12F675 also has some additional features such as a built-in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a comparator, which the PIC12F629 does not have. The PIC12F675 also has a larger number of general-purpose I/O pins (5) compared to the PIC12F629 (3).

It has been confirmed that [PIC12F629](https://www.arcade-projects.com/threads/cps2-suicide-free-modchip.8861/post-142518) works.

### Tools Needed

- Soldering Iron
- Desoldering gun/tool
- T20 Security Torx Bit
- PIC12F675
- PIC Programmer

### Steps

Once this is completed you can remove the battery. Note you don't need to [short the capacitor](https://www.arcade-projects.com/threads/cps2-suicide-free-modchip.8861/post-141822).

## CPS2 3.6v Battery Replacement

### Tools Needed
- Soldering Iron
- Desoldering tool/gun
- 22g solder or anything else
- T20 Security Torx Bit
- Multimeter
- 3.6v Half AA Battery with Axial leads

If you would like to replace the battery soldered directly to the board a Keystone Mod (holder) would be a batter option. This saves you from doing any soldering as you just replace the battery in the holder.

The problem with the above is that you still have a battery on your board

## InfiniKey CPS2 Mod
If you have multiple boards the cost of the InfiniKey adds up. A PIC12F675 will set you back in 2023 around $2 AUD a piece.
